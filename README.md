# You Are An Idiot

![Screenshot of Program](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96622265/210052516-4b1940b8-18a7-4934-96cd-6fd081fe206d.png)

This is a simple program I made to imitate the old `youareanidiot.org` javascript virus. However, this program only
shows a single window, and it doesn't stop you from closing it.

## Run/Build Instructions

To run this program, either run `main.py` with a Python interpreter, or run the compiled executable located in the
`Releases` folder of this repository.

To build this program, navigate into this folder in cmd or Powershell, and run
`pyinstaller "You Are An Idiot.spec"`.

## Credits

- The window and executable icons are made from modifying the "White Smiling Face `â˜º`" unicode character.
- The toggle full screen button icons are drawn by me.
